        Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
I trust you'll understand the reference to another Scottish tragedy
Without my having to name the play.
They think me Macbeth, ambition is my folly
I'm a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain.
Madison is Banquo
Jefferson's Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane.
And there you are an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
And I cannot put the notion away.
Take a break.
I am on my way.
There's a little surprise before supper and it cannot wait
I'll be there in just a minute, save my plate
Alexander
Okay, okay
Your son is nine years old today
He has something he'd like to say
He's been practicing all day
Philip, take it away
Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just to show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes but you can't write mine
What!
I practice French and play piano with my mother
Uh-huh
I have a sister but I want a little brother
Okay
My daddy's trying to start America's bank
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq!
Bravo!
Take a break
Hey, our kid is pretty great
Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate
Eliza, I've got so much on my plate
We can all go stay with my father
There's a lake I know
I know
In a nearby park
I'd love to go
You and I can go when the night gets dark
I will try to get away
My dearest Alexander, you must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don't stop 'til you agree
Your favourite older sister Angelica reminds you
There's someone in your corner all the way across the sea
In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning, did you intend this?
One stroke and you've consumed my waking days
It says
"My dearest, Angelica"
With a comma after dearest
You've written
"My dearest, Angelica"
Anyway, all this to say
I'm coming home this summer
At my sister's invitation
I'll be there with your family if you make your way upstate
I know you're very busy, I know your work's important
But I'm crossing the ocean and I just can't wait
You won't be an ocean away
You'll only be a moment away
Alexander come downstairs, Angelica's arriving today
Angelica!
Eliza!
The Schuyler sisters
Alexander!
Hi
It's good to see your face
Angelica, tell this man, John Adams spends the summer with his family
Angelica, tell my wife, John Adams doesn't have a real job anyway
You're not joining us? Wait-
I'm afraid I cannot join you upstate
Alexander, I came all this way
She came all this way
All this way
Take a break
You know I have to get my plan through Congress
Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate
I'll lose my job if we don't get this plan through Congress
We'll all go stay with our father
There's a lake I know
I know I'll miss your face
In a nearby park
Screw your courage to the sticking place
You and I can go
Eliza's right
Take a break
Take a break and get away
Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate
Where we can stay
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time, you will make your mark
Look around, look around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now
Close your eyes and dream
We can go
When the night gets dark
Take a break
I have to get my plan through Congress
I can't stop 'til I get this plan through Congress
