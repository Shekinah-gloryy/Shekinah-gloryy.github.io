        GREY'S ANATOMY <br>
        2x16: It's the End of the World (Part 1)<br>
        Original Airdate: 2/5/2006 <br>
        Written by: Shonda Rhimes <br>
        Directed by: Peter Horton<br>
        (OR)<br>
        (Large light overhead from an OR flashing on. A heart monitor is beeping in the background) <br>
        MVO: It's a look patients get in their eyes. <br>
    (Meredith is standing decked out in full scrubs gear in the OR which is dead silent aside from the heart monitor. She is breathing heavily and teary eyed)<br>
        MVO: There is a scent. The smell of death.<br>(Derek is standing opposite to her also in his scrub gear just looking at her. The OR is absolutely completely empty. No tables, no equipment, no other people, nada aside from them two. Meredith is holding out one of her hands to Derek)<br>
    MVO: Some kind of sixth sense.<br>
    (Meredith sheds a tear. The tear trails down her face to her chin, where it hangs)<br>
    MVO: When the great beyond is headed for you, you feel it coming.<br>
    The heart-monitor flat lines and the tear falls from her chin)<br>
    MVO: What's the one thing you've always dreamed of doing before you die? <br>
    (The screen goes black)<br>
    (Meredith's house, shower)<br>
    (Izzie and Meredith appear to be showering together and scrubbing each other sensuously. Cristina is also in there helping them. They look like they're having a blast)<br>
    MVO: Ok, hello? Clearly not my dream.<br>
    (The shower screen door opens revealing George who also appears naked with a towel wrapped around his waist. The three girls turn their attention to them)<br>
    Izzie: You're the strongest most masculine man I have ever known.<br>
    Cristina: You're smarter than me. And you've got really great hair.<br>
    Meredith: I'm in love with you, George. I always have been and I always will be.<br>
    (George enters the shower and shuts the door behind. He then re-opens it, tosses his towel on the ground. Scene switches abruptly to George falling from his bed)<br>
    Meredith: I'm just not going.
