        <td> Faithful by Kim Cash Tate tells the story of three women—Cydney, Dana, 
          and Phyllis—who face significant challenges in their lives, grappling with 
          issues such as betrayal, heartbreak, and the search for purpose. Through their 
          ndividual struggles, they form a deep bond and begin to understand the power of
           faith, forgiveness, and trusting in God's timing. As they navigate their personal
            journeys, each woman learns that while life is often difficult and unpredictable, 
            God's faithfulness remains constant, and His plan for them is always greater than 
            their circumstances. The novel highlights themes of healing, resilience, and the
             importance of community and spiritual growth in overcoming adversity.</td>
