        <td> Follows Don Tillman, a brilliant but socially awkward genetics professor, 
            as he embarks on a quest to find the perfect wife. His solution: create the "Wife Project," 
            a rigorous questionnaire designed to weed out unsuitable candidates. However, 
            his plans are thrown off course when he meets Rosie Jarman, 
            an unpredictable bartender who is nothing like the woman he imagines for 
            himself. As they work together to uncover the identity of Rosie's biological 
            father, Don's rigid worldview begins to shift, leading him to discover that love 
            doesn't follow formulas. The novel is a heartwarming, humorous exploration of love, 
            relationships, and personal growth.</td>
